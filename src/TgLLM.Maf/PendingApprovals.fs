/// One live, undecided approval. Holds the LIVE MAF request object — required to build the resume
/// content via `request.CreateResponse` — which is exactly why this table cannot survive a process
/// restart even though the buttons' bindings (`IBindingStore`) can: a post-restart tap still routes
/// and is acked by the engine, but deterministically lands in the stale path
/// (`IMafObserver.OnStaleDecision`).
///
/// Deliberately does NOT carry the decision buttons' own `CallbackToken`s: `TgLLM.FSharp.TgBot`
/// exposes no accessor for the binding store, or for the tokens `SendKeyboardPlan`/
/// `EditKeyboardPlan` assign internally, so there is no seam this leaf can reach to remove an
/// untapped sibling button's binding as post-decision hygiene. This is not a correctness gap: the
/// at-most-once guarantee rests entirely on `PendingApprovals.TryConsume`'s atomic remove, not on
/// binding cleanup — an untapped sibling binding is simply left to expire or be superseded, never
/// able to resume a second time regardless.
