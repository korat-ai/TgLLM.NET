/// The on-disk LiteDB document shape of one `ToolBinding`. NOT marked `private`/`internal`
/// (disclosed deviation from the usual "hide the DTO" instinct, mirroring `TgLLM.Persistence.
/// BindingDto`'s own identical disclosed deviation): LiteDB's default `BsonMapper` only reflects
/// over PUBLIC types — verified the hard way, by decompiling the installed 5.0.21 assembly
/// (Principle V) and observing that marking this type `internal` made `BsonMapper` silently treat
/// every instance as an empty object, auto-generating an `ObjectId` primary key and persisting NONE
/// of the actual fields, rather than erroring — `BsonMapper`'s own doc comment states the
/// requirement plainly ("Classes must be public with a public constructor without parameters"),
/// but the FAILURE MODE for violating it is silent data loss, not an exception, which is worth
/// recording here so nobody "helpfully" re-adds `internal` later.
///
/// `[<CLIMutable>]`: the OTHER half of that same requirement — a public constructor WITHOUT
/// parameters, plus settable properties. A plain immutable F# record has neither (only the
/// all-fields constructor); `[<CLIMutable>]` is exactly the compiler feature for this: it emits a
/// public parameterless constructor and public get/set properties for an otherwise-idiomatic F#
/// record, with no change to how F# code itself constructs/reads one (`{ Id = ...; ToolName = ... }`
/// still works).
///
/// `Id` is LiteDB's own primary-key convention (a property literally named `Id`, case-insensitive,
/// needs no `[<BsonId>]` attribute) — holds the token's canonical string, mirroring `BindingDto.
/// Token` in the file store's own DTO. `ExpiresAtUtc` is `Nullable<DateTime>`, not
/// `DateTimeOffset`: `BsonValue` has no native `DateTimeOffset` conversion (verified against the
/// same assembly — only a `DateTime` conversion exists), so the domain's `DateTimeOffset` is
/// normalized to its UTC instant at the boundary; `Expiry.isLive`'s comparison only ever cares
/// about the absolute instant, so this is lossless for the one thing that matters, even though the
/// original (irrelevant) offset itself isn't preserved.
